# Labmentix-Internship-Developing-a-Stock-Price-Prediction-Model-for-Yes-Bank-Using-Machine-Learning

This project presents a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, designed to predict the closing stock price of Yes Bank. Leveraging historical stock data and advanced machine learning models, the application provides valuable insights for investors and financial analysts.

Key Features:

Interactive User Interface: A clean and intuitive web interface allows users to input relevant stock data, including open, high, and low prices, along with a specific date.
Multiple Machine Learning Models: The application utilizes several pre-trained machine learning models, including Random Forest, Ridge Regression, Linear Regression, and Gradient Boosting, to generate predictions.
Historical Data Integration: The application integrates historical Yes Bank stock data to provide context and compare predicted values with actual closing prices.
Real-Time Prediction: Upon user input, the application instantly generates predicted closing prices based on the selected models.
Prediction Accuracy Analysis: The application calculates and displays the differences between predicted and actual closing prices, highlighting the accuracy of each model.
Visual Presentation: The application presents data and predictions in a clear and visually appealing manner, using dataframes and metrics.
Customizable UI/UX: The application is styled with custom CSS to provide an attractive and user-friendly experience, with a focus on usability and visual appeal.
Technologies Used:

Streamlit: For building the interactive web interface.
Python: For data processing, model loading, and application logic.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn (joblib): For loading and utilizing pre-trained machine learning models and the scaler.
Matplotlib: For potential visualizations (if you include them).
CSS: For custom styling and UI enhancements.
Purpose:

This application aims to provide a practical tool for:

Investors seeking to make informed decisions regarding Yes Bank stock.
Financial analysts looking to evaluate the performance of different prediction models.
Individuals interested in learning about stock price prediction and machine learning.
How to Use:

Users can input the necessary stock data through the provided input fields and select a date. By clicking the "Predict" button, the application will display the predicted closing prices generated by each model, along with the actual closing price (if available) and the differences between predictions and actual values.

Potential Enhancements:

Implement interactive visualizations of historical and predicted data.
Add features for saving and exporting prediction results.
Incorporate real-time stock data updates.
Expand the application to include predictions for other stocks.
Add more machine learning models.
Add error handling and user feedback.
